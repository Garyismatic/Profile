    <h2>Software Developer</h2>
    <h1>Gary Evans </h1>
    <p>I'm Gary, a career switcher based in Essex, working towards a
    long-term future in software development. After completing a full-time
    JavaScript bootcamp with Northcoders, I went on to mentor new students at
    the same bootcamp, helping them build full-stack projects while
    strengthening my own skills. I’ve built applications using JavaScript,
    React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and TypeScript, and I enjoy solving problems by
    reading documentation and getting hands-on with code. I’m also exploring
    Python and learning more about how data and systems work behind the scenes.
    Before tech, I spent years in customer-facing and leadership roles. That
    experience taught me how to communicate well, stay calm under pressure, and
    work with people from all backgrounds, skills I carry into every project I
    work on now. Right now, I’m looking for my first junior developer role in a
    team that’s collaborative and supportive, where I can keep learning and
    start making a real contribution.</p>
