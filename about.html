      <h2>HI!</h2>
      <p>I’m Gary (which you probably already know if you are reading this).</p>
      <p>
        I'm a junior developer based in the UK, currently looking for an
        opportunity to join a team where I can grow, contribute, and reach my
        full potential. I've successfully completed an intensive software
        development bootcamp, where I learned how to build full-stack
        applications using JavaScript, React, Express, and PostgreSQL.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, I work part-time to get me by while actively pursuing a
        career in tech. I’m keen to find a role that will challenge me, help me
        to grow and keep learning, and ideally explore areas like mobile
        development in the future.
      </p>
      <h4>Can you help with that?.</h4>
      <p>
        When I’m not coding, you’ll usually find me spending time with my
        family, out on the golf course, playing board games with friends, or
        grabbing something decent to eat. Thanks for stopping by — feel free to
        check out my projects or get in touch.
      </p>
      <p>OK BYE!</p>
