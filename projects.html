        <img src="assets/Code-image.png" class="project-image" />
        <p class="project-description">
          Article Avenue is a front-end news app built with React, allowing
          users to browse, filter, sort and interact with articles and comments
          from various topics. It consumes a custom-built RESTful APIâ€”also
          developed by me which handles content like voting, commenting, and
          article sorting. Developed as a solo bootcamp project, Article Avenue
          showcases front-end skills and API integration fetching, creating,
          patching and in some cases deleting data. This project was built with
          Test Driven Development principles in mind.

        <p class="project-description">
          AceScript is a full-stack web app developed as my bootcamp final
          project. Designed to help junior developers improve their skills, it
          lets users solve coding challenges directly in the browser on a code
          editor and get instant feedback via pre-written test cases and console
          logs created by the user. Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS and
          MongoDB, it features user authentication, challenge filtering, and a
          user profile to track progress. This was a group project over several
          weeks from inception to completion and showcases my ability to work
          and deliver on something as part of a team
